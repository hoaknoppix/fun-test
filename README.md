This is a fun assignment
![System Architecture](design.png)
Time spent: ~8 hours

How to run:
- Install docker.
- in the root repo folder, excute: sh ./run.sh.
- import postman.json or use curl command to play around.
 
As there are no time so there are several things remain:
- Integration tests are done manual on postman (As you can see on postman.json), cucumber is more preferable.
- Retry technique isn't implemented.
- Mututation tests aren't applied.
- Authentication isn't implemented.
- The idea to make the booking more precise and smarter by spatial query aren't implemented yet.

Relfection:
- 1. It could be a designing phrase, I love seeing the whole picture before implementing.
- 2. Also in design pharse, some of the requirements aren't clear, such as the report and the get /taxis are realtime or not, so I made design decision based on my assumption.
